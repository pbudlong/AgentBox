0) Landing page (AgentBox)Goal: convince both sides (Sellers & Buyers) to use AgentBox emails so their agents can qualify fit and auto-schedule only when it’s worth it.HeroHeadline: Stop wasting meetings.Subhead: AgentBox lets your email act like you—qualify fit, ask clarifying questions, and book meetings only when there’s a match.Primary CTA: Get your AgentBox email →Secondary CTA: See a live two-agent demo →Why Sellers• Fewer no-shows, better win rates — only qualified buyers make it to your calendar.• Automatic discovery & follow-ups — your agent asks missing questions, nudges respectfully, and closes loops.• Faster handoffs — summary + CRM-ready notes in every thread.Why Buyers• No pitch spam — your agent filters inbound sellers to your criteria.• One-email intake — the agent gathers details from the seller so you don’t have to.• Calendars respected — meetings happen only when there’s clear value.How it works (3 steps)1. Claim your @agentbox.ai address (e.g., aria@agentbox.ai).2. Set preferences (industry, company size, budget, timing, tools).3. Email another AgentBox address — the agents converse, score fit, and book only if above threshold.Social proof / Trust• Built on modern agent infra; works with your calendar & CRM.• You’re always bCC’d for preselected stages; one-click “pause/override.”• Data stays in your workspace; export any time.Footer• Pricing (free during beta), Docs, Directory, FAQ, Contact.1) Discovery: how a seller finds a buyer’s AgentBox emailYou need something that works today in a hackathon. Use a simple, layered approach:LinkedIn placement (fastest to demo)Ask users to add their AgentBox email in:• LinkedIn Contact info (Email)• And optionally in the Headline (“Chat with my agent: aria@agentbox.ai”)Demo: click a sample LinkedIn profile screenshot → copy address → start the agent thread.2) Side-by-side email clients (conversation viewer)One page, two columns:• Left column: Seller inbox (e.g., pete@agentbox.ai) view of the thread• Right column: Buyer inbox (e.g., aria@agentbox.ai) view of the same thread• Each message shows: from, to, subject, time, and message body.• Live update: poll your backend every 2–3s (or use Convex live queries) to render new messages.• Controls bar (top): Start demo thread, Toggle “Ask a clarifying question,” Force low/high score, Reset.Implementation notes (Replit)• Single Node/Express app.• /public for static HTML (TailwindCDN for speed).• /api/threads/:id returns normalized messages (direction, sender, body).• Keep a tiny ThreadState store (in Convex or local JSON) and append messages as your webhook fires.3) Middle-agent (fit scoring + clarify + schedule)Flow (event-driven)1. Inbound email to pete@ or aria@ → webhook hits POST /webhooks/agentmail with message + threadId.2. Load profiles for both sides; extract signals (industry, size, geo, intent, timing, budget, authority, stack).3. Compute score (weighted sum).4. Decision:o If score ≥ threshold_meet → propose 2–3 slots and (optionally) place a hold on acceptance.o If threshold_clarify ≤ score < threshold_meet → send one clarifying question for missing signals.o If score < threshold_clarify → polite decline (or share resources).5. Writeback summary to the thread + store in state for the dashboard.Data model (minimal)SellerProfile: { handle, company, website, industry: string[], sizeRange, geo, productCategories: string[], valueProps: string[], priceModel, icpRules: string[], disqualifiers: string[] }BuyerProfile:  { handle, company, website, industry: string[], sizeRange, geo, stackSignals: string[], budgetBand?: string, timing?: string, mustHave?: string[] }ThreadState:   { threadId, sellerHandle, buyerHandle, status: 'collecting'|'approved'|'declined'|'scheduled',                 lastScore: number, missing: string[], summary?: string, event?: { when, link } }ScoringConfig:{ weights: Record<string, number>, thresholdClarify: number, thresholdMeet: number }Signals (0–1 each)• industry_match, size_match, geo_match• need_intent (verbs/problems extracted from first buyer message)• timing, budget, authority (title from signature), stack_compatibility (keywords)Score = Σ weightᵢ × signalᵢEmail templates (plain + short)• Clarify: “To confirm fit, could you share your current [tool] and rough budget band?”• Approve: “Looks like a strong fit based on [signals]. Here are 3 times that work: [A/B/C]. Reply with A/B/C and I’ll confirm.”• Scheduled in calendar – show Composio scheduling• Decline: “Thanks for reaching out—based on [reasons], this likely isn’t a fit. Sharing a resource you may find useful: [link].”4) One-person build plan (Replit)Folder layout/index.html            # Landing page + Directory search/demo.html             # Side-by-side two-inbox viewer/server.ts             # Express app (webhooks + APIs + static)/lib/agentmail.ts      # sendEmail(), listThread(threadId), normalizeMessage()/lib/scoring.ts        # extractSignals(), score(), decide()/lib/store.ts          # in-memory or Convex bindings/seed/profiles.json    # sample Seller/Buyer profiles/public/               # CSS (Tailwind via CDN), logosKey endpoints• POST /webhooks/agentmail – handle inbound email → extract → score → decide → send reply → update store• GET /api/threads/:id – return normalized messages for left/right panes• POST /api/demo/start – seed a demo thread (first seller email)• POST /api/demo/force – set status to approved/clarify/decline (for live demo control)• GET /api/directory?q= – simple handle search for discovery flowSuggested tech choices (keep it simple)• DB: start with in-memory store (object in /lib/store.ts). If time allows, switch to Convex for realtime updates.• Auth: none needed for demo.• Scheduling: reply-based booking (A/B/C). If time remains, add a lightweight Google Calendar hold.What to show the judges (tight 90-sec flow)1. Landing page (two bullets each for Sellers/Buyers) → “Claim @agentbox.ai.”2. Directory → find “aria” → email opens to aria@agentbox.ai.3. Two-inbox demo: start thread; watch agents ask 1 clarifying q, rescore ≥ threshold, propose slots, buyer replies “B,” confirmation email + summary appears.4. Outcome card shows score + matched signals + scheduled time.5. Close with: “AgentBox stops low-value meetings and books the right ones automatically—via the inbox you already use.”
