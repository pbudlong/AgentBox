3) Middle-agent (fit scoring + clarify + schedule)Flow (event-driven)1. Inbound email to pete@ or aria@ → webhook hits POST /webhooks/agentmail with message + threadId.2. Load profiles for both sides; extract signals (industry, size, geo, intent, timing, budget, authority, stack).3. Compute score (weighted sum).4. Decision:o If score ≥ threshold_meet → propose 2–3 slots and (optionally) place a hold on acceptance.o If threshold_clarify ≤ score < threshold_meet → send one clarifying question for missing signals.o If score < threshold_clarify → polite decline (or share resources).5. Writeback summary to the thread + store in state for the dashboard.Data model (minimal)SellerProfile: { handle, company, website, industry: string[], sizeRange, geo, productCategories: string[], valueProps: string[], priceModel, icpRules: string[], disqualifiers: string[] }BuyerProfile:  { handle, company, website, industry: string[], sizeRange, geo, stackSignals: string[], budgetBand?: string, timing?: string, mustHave?: string[] }ThreadState:   { threadId, sellerHandle, buyerHandle, status: 'collecting'|'approved'|'declined'|'scheduled',                 lastScore: number, missing: string[], summary?: string, event?: { when, link } }ScoringConfig:{ weights: Record<string, number>, thresholdClarify: number, thresholdMeet: number }Signals (0–1 each)• industry_match, size_match, geo_match• need_intent (verbs/problems extracted from first buyer message)• timing, budget, authority (title from signature), stack_compatibility (keywords)Score = Σ weightᵢ × signalᵢEmail templates (plain + short)• Clarify: “To confirm fit, could you share your current [tool] and rough budget band?”• Approve: “Looks like a strong fit based on [signals].
